I went there for a nice fresh lobster dinner, but instead went with the   soft shell crab done w garlic oil, the entire 3 crabs were  completely soaked in some ? sauce that was very watered down and old fishy tasting. then the  rice piao was  old  clumps of  rice with old fishy  seafood and very dry lobster then the  ""fish soup""  5 dollars  was a horror, some thickened  corn starch with extremely  old fish taste no identifiable  fish in it. the  Spanish  antipasto was some sliced up  pieces  of goat cheese, salami and overly soaked asparagus and pepper.

I ordered the Fish and Chips and an Ice Tea (Can't drink during work hours). I should have had a clue when they said they are out of ice tea. All I can say is this was the worst food I have ever tasted in New York City. The fries and the fish were dripping and soaked with oil, just plain nasty. I picked through some of this disgusting plate and could not come close to finishing, COMPLETELY INEDIBLE! Their chef should be embarassed to serve such a plate. I would give zero stars if I could.

94048,1248,bad,1,6/24/12,"Hartford Pizza's hamburger/cheeseburger subs are the worst I, and my friends, have ever had anywhere. The times we've had it, the burger is broken up into uneven little dry chunks by hand and placed on top of all the lettuce and cheese etc. This is NOT how this sandwich is supposed to be made! The pieces of burger should not be in dry uneven chunks resting on top of everything else in the sandwich; they should be cut into even pieces with a KNIFE after having cheese melted onto the meat while cooking, then toppings placed around this conglomeration, to make it delicious and melty and right! The pizza is pretty good, but it EXTREMELY overpriced. A large pizza is the size of a medium pizza, and is $17.00 with just pepperoni and one vegetable topping. And ours was cut totally uneven, with large pieces on the left and tiny pieces on the right. How hard can it be to make a sandwich or a pizza the right way? And charge an appropriate price?

Mind you, we got there around 12:45 (were seated immediately and Kathy came right way) and left hungry at 1:32.  Just ridiculous but the top of the cake was having our waitress come with an attitude and let us know that it was not her fault and that she put the order on time which we suspect she didn't because the ticket that she showed us had an entry of 1:30.  She quickly recovered by saying that the time printed was the time she printed out the ticket to show us then she goes on and tell us that they had a party going on in their party room and that again it wasn't her fault.  The thing that did it for me was her attitude - NASTY in my opinion.  Never again we will be going here, even if I think they have the best ice cream in NJ.",2010,Confectionately Yours

111482,1545,bad,-1,10/13/12,"I wish this could be a positive review, but I'm afraid the positive points of this establishment are strongly outweighed by negatives. Summary:  The food is average quality for common dishes, with an occasional inedible dish thrown into the mix. The location is terrible. The atmosphere is hole-in-the-wall, slightly ghetto, almost take-out-only. The service is slow but friendly, with a language barrier that complicates ordering. The price is high for what you get.  RATING: D Location As a person who has to drive there, the location of Saffron Place is the single biggest detractor from this establishment. The horrific Park Road location drops the rating down to 2 stars. During dinner pickup time there is NO parking on a very busy street. I had to park in a less-than-legal location on the street in order to quickly grab my order. So, the extra 10 or 15 minute wait inside had me thinking about getting a ticket the entire time. To top it off, during dinner time rush hour traffic I almost got hit twice going to and from the restaurant. People drive crazy in Hartford & West Hartford at that hour. Even if the food was fantastic, I would never go back because of the shockingly poor location and it's associated driving implications. Of course, none of this matters if you're walking there. Food I ordered quite a bit of food for my entire family, totaling $73.51: - 1 chicken tikka masala. Average sauce, with tender pieces of chicken. Small portion. - 1 tandoori chicken. The best entrée of the bunch. Tender, spicy chicken with just the right amount of char. Expensive. - 1 vegetable vindaloo. Very spicy.. and pretty good. Best value. - 1 lamb curry. Average sauce with somewhat hard pieces of lamb. Very small portion. - 2 orders of vegetable samosas. Quite good. Cooked just right. Decent size (2 per order). - 2 orders of basmati rice. Meh.  The basmati flavor was hidden by curry spice, which I didn't order or expect. It was fast-food grade rice. - Mango chutney & hot/spicy sauce.  These spices were tiny for the price. The chutney was quite good, but we could have used 3 times as much for 4 people. - 2 naan bread. Decent. Harder and chewier than most other Indian restaurants. - 2 chapati bread. Missing from the order. - The dinners came with two orders of sweet / sour apple filling (I'm not sure what it's called). The sour flavoring was unappealing to everyone. We threw it out, and I hate throwing out food. Atmosphere The atmosphere is hole-in-the-wall, slightly ghetto, almost take-out-only. If you look at the photo in the Yelp profile, you will see a room with a green wall, a few tables and a cash register. This is the entire restaurant. It's not what I would consider a sit-down restaurant. The place is clean but unappealing, and certainly not a 'date restaurant'.  The cooks and waiter can easily be heard in the back room talking about what is being ordered & cooked. The place smells of burnt oil and, not surprisingly, curry. The busy road immediately outside doesn't help matters. Service I called in my order at 4:25 PM. I showed up at the restaurant at 5:25 PM, but I then waited for 10 minutes for the food to be ready. Way too slow. There were two people ahead of me with much smaller orders. The waiter was friendly and personable. When I got home I found out that some of my order was either the wrong item, missing items, or the wrong number of a particular item. There was some sort of horrific pickled meat included in the order that we had to throw out because it was so unpalatable. The bones included in the dish didn't help. One of the naan breads were missing. And the Chapati bread was completely missing from the order. Interestingly, when the waiter was ringing up my order he had to look up the price of every single item I ordered from their take-out menu, which means he surprisingly did not know any of the prices. It took 3 or 4 minutes for him to do this while I waited. Then, when I gave him the cash and the coupon he did not have more than $20 in singles in the register and no change. After asking if I had coins (I didn't), he had to reach into his pocket to give me the appropriate coinage. Price The total price for the order was $73.51, which was reduced to $43.51 with a $30 Groupon coupon. The price of the basmati/curry rice was very reasonable for $2.50 per aluminum take-out tray.  $2.50 for two tasty samosas is very reasonable, also. Every one of the entrées are all overpriced. $11.50 for 4-5 ounces of mediocre Chicken tikka masala or  4 ounces of curried lamb is outrageous. $17 for a Tandoori chicken leg and half of a chicken breast is quite steep, too.  None of the dishes can feed two people, without ordering extra rice, samosas, or extra bread. The vegetable vindaloo was the best deal of the bunch; one full pint of tasty, spicy veggies for $8.50. Again, for two people you probably want to order extra rice with that. I will never go back to Saffron Place, even with a $30 Groupon coupon.",2012,Saffron Place

202423,3424,bad,1,11/7/13,"I have never written a bad review about a restaurant, but I felt compelled to write this so that no one else makes the same mistake that I did!! I have eaten at CM's on at least 5 prior occasions and have been pleased with the food quality and service. Believing that it would be the same this time, I decided to bring my family there for restaurant week and order off of that menu. This was a last minute reservation I called in approx 3 hours before arriving, and appreciated that they were willing to accommodate the request. I ordered fried calamari, which was a ""serving for two."" Restaurant week menus include appetizer, dinner, and dessert. Because this was supposedly to serve 2, my father did not order an appetizer since we were going to share. To my dismay when the calamari arrived there was possibly 2 large spoonfulls worth, if that. I had about 5 pieces, my dad maybe 6, and that was our ""serving for two."" A little disappointed, I hoped that dinner would be a marked improvement.... wow was I wrong. Also note that complimentary salads were not provided, as they almost always are at any restaurant prior to entree. Dinner: My choice was a sea scallop dish that was served over pasta. I received 3 scallops, and about 3 forkfulls worth of pasta. I would guess that the total amount of pasta I had was about 1/4 to 1/3 of a cup, if that. It barely covered the bottom of my plate (my father also ordered the same meal). I asked the waitress to bring out some cheese and it took at least 10 minutes from when I made the request to the time she appeared at the table. By this time, my pasta was lukewarm. My mom ordered a chicken dish which was marginally more generous than the pasta, but all three of us were incredibly disappointed with the unacceptably small portions. I can understand if you don't want to include more than 3 scallops. But honestly, providing the diner with at least a cup of pasta literally costs a restaurant pennies, if that. We were all quite hungry, and the dessert was equally disappointing. The dining room was full when we were there, which I believe really affected the level of service we received. While our waitress had a great personality and seemed quite pleasant, I really hoped that she would take the time to ask for our feedback regarding our dining experience. This never happened, which is part of the reason why I'm writing this review. Our check came to about $130 for 3 of us, and we all genuinely felt that it was outrageously high given the ridiculously small portion sizes. If you subtract amount spent on drinks, total cost for 3 dinners ended up being around $105 before tax. I don't want to dissuade diners from going to CM's if you're looking to have some bar food and a few drinks. For that, it's great. However, this was a night out that both me and my family really looked forward to, and it was a considerable let down given the lack of attentive service and reasonable portion sizes. I dine out at least once-twice per week, and gladly pay (and tip) for great food and service. However, For $32 each person, there's absolutely no reason why they can't ensure that diners receive a quality experience with reasonable, dinner-sized portions to encourage repeat visits.

I actually love the size of the place, I think it has a warm and fuzzy homemade feel about it, and in the summer there are tables set up outside, so there's a little more space.  The ONLY thing I could suggest, is more vegetarian options.  I know vegetarian sandwiches can be a little tricky to conjure up, but as of right now there are only two vegetarian sandwich options on the menu.",2014,The Cove Deli

Can't keep track of who came in first when they have too many people waiting in a stuffy little barroom for a table. Tried to sit a party that came in after us, first. We order 1/2 chicken, 1/2 ribs order. With a spit full of chicken & ribs, they told us there was a 45 minute because what we were looking at was for other orders. When I asked the woman what that mean (from the waiter) she tells me that it's one big take-out order on the spit and we have to wait 45 minutes if we want chick/ribs. So we ordered shrimp/garlic which, btw, was terrible. Ate bread/butter and soda/water. (we were 2 & child). All we wanted was 1/2 ribs, 1/2 chicken order. They removed all the meats off the spit and into the kitchen and proceed to fill the spit again. While we eat shrimp the table of 2 attached to us get chicken/ribs.  Table next to us gets chicken/ribs. I call the woman over again, she tells me they ordered before you. How would she know? She was at the front of the restaurant when we sat down. The best insult though was when the next table got food. Remember the party I mentioned earlier that almost sat down before us, but arrived after us. Well, they got seated after us and right behind me (I knew because i had to move my chair in for them). They got 2 platters waaayy after we got our shrimp.......yes, CHICKEN/RIBS. At that point I got up and went over to the woman and told her what we witnessed and how poorly we were treated.

We were waiting for over 10 minutes for someone to come over and serve us water, let alone take our order. Two tables that were seated AFTER us were promptly served with water, and had attentive servers. Despite the restaurant being more than half empty, there was absolutely no move on part of the servers to look to us. What the hell?

242789,4448,bad,1,2/19/11,"My wife and I had high hopes for this restaurant. We are fans of Daniel and Jean Georges, and even a beautiful little restaurant in Boulder (CO) called L'Atelier, so our assumption was that Bouley would at least be in the same league. Wrong. This restaurant is for fans of disinterested service, unimaginative cuisine, and dungeon-style environs (we were in the ""private"" dining room). Advice to lunch goers: stay far, far away from the Boston Bibb - it's literally a few pieces of lettuce stacked on top of arugula and mushrooms (we make better salads at home) - an unsightly and disappointing effort from the kitchen of Chef Bouley. This dish would NOT pass in any self-respecting restaurant in Provence. The carpaccio was a very simple crudo; these guys could really learn from the wintergreen tuna that Jean Georges used to offer. We ordered some chilled chatham oysters a la carte: flavors were acceptable, although I really would have preferred a simple goat cheese or mascarpone instead of their ""lemon cloud"", which I felt overwhelmed the other flavors in the dish, particularly the oysters themselves. Boo on that. This is what the porcini flan tasted like: crack one egg into a bowl, add some water, toss in lump crab meat, put in the microwave on HIGH for 45 seconds, and BAM you have their porcini flan. The salmon was fine but really could have used a nice sear. Duck was fine ... if you've never had nice duck before. Coming from someone who enjoys the intense flavors of Beijing Roast Duck (in Beijing, not Chinatown), this creamy bland version of duck really paled in comparison. It's one thing if the flavors were to exhibit a high level of sophistication, but sorry, merely adding some foam doesn't quite count. Venison was reminded me of a strange take on a popular chinese dish called ""mutton with soaked bread"" except not nearly as good. I am not convinced gnocchi ought to go with anything that is not tomato-based unless there is a toast or sear or something that provides some sort of mediation. Coconut soup was basically whole-milk yogurt with shaved ice. You could tell the milk they used for the yogurt came from healthy cows, although at this type of restaurant that's expected. Dessert was excellent, particularly the chocolate, although the pear was no slouch. In summary, restaurants like Daniel and Jean Georges have this joint thoroughly dominated in every respect - except for maybe the furniture, and perhaps the dessert course. Warning to first-time customers: when you reserve, be sure to indicate you want to sit in the ""main dining room only"". Otherwise there is a good chance you will be whisked to the basement (read: dungeon) where there is no natural light, and despite the neo-French decor, lacks a feeling of warmth.",2011,Bouley

Also the sauce is way too salty. Normally I like salty food but that's all you taste. It's just not a well executed pizza. I had the hangover pizza once before also. Not as salty but same crust issue. Bad. Last night I also had the baby Jesus cake. Let me add this is the only reason I went here at 10pm on a Saturday night. This time when I got it I'm certain it had been in the freezer too long because if had that freezer burnt after taste to it. What a shame.

138462,2035,bad,-1,6/2/13,"**This review is just on the burgers (and a little on the service) Completely over-priced, less-than-average burgers and poor communication. I ended up coming to this place because of the positive Yelp reviews. After my experience here, I can only surmise that the reviews are written by employees, or friends of the owner, James. I'm going to breakdown my experience into positives and negatives and say that I urge you not to come here--at least not for burgers. The bar seems like it could be alright. Positives: - The initial vibe was cool - Very spacious - The maple pineapple topping is really tasty! Negatives: - Misleading menu for burgers. The presentation and extras for the ""Single"" and ""Double"" burger makes it seem (to 3 out of 4 of us) that the $12 or $16 burger comes with all the items listed below the description, and that you can add on cheese for $1. THIS IS NOT THE CASE. THE BURGERS ARE PLAIN (Save lettuce, tomato and pickles). - The waiter was not clear about menu items, even when asked, causing confusion. I asked the waiter what the difference between the ""Joe Louis"" burger and the regular burgers were, as they all listed the same ingredients/extras on the menu. He said the only difference was that the Louis burger was an 8 oz patty and the others were 4 oz. patties. THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. The truth is that the single and double burgers only come with lettuce, tomato and pickles (which mine showed up without anyways), and each additional topping is $1. I WOULD HAVE NEVER PAID $12 for a plain, average burger--especially when I could go to Peter Luger's and get an amazing 1/2 lb Porterhouse burger for a few bucks less! - The poor state of the food. One of the burgers came out cold, another, ordered medium-rare was medium well, and two were missing pickles. All of them had a very, very small amount of fries (maybe 8-10 fries). - Upon paying the bill, I paid with Amex (the only credit card they accept here). When I got my copy to sign, it was $3 more than the bill I was given. The waiter quickly explained that this was the ""credit card fee"", and said so in a tone like ""duh, this is that credit card fee all restaurants charge when you use a credit card"". THIS FEE WAS NOT EXPLAINED TO ME BEFORE MY CARD WAS RUN. - The burger patty. I am almost 100% sure that the patties are pre-formed frozen pattys. Why? The burger was about a cm thick, and had flat, even edges around the sides. This is typical for a pre-formed, frozen patty. Much like a Gardenburger. This was honestly one the most disappointing meals/experiences I've had in a restaurant since I moved to NY a year ago. I wish I could get my money back and I would not go back for burgers even if someone else was paying for it.

We were in a hurry and needed to find someplace to stop on our route. At a crossroads in the country, we spotted Jersey Girls. We pulled into the parking lot. A hand-painted sandwich board boasted of local-everything breakfast sandwiches. Agreeing that this was indeed the place to stop, we walked in to a clean, sunlit space full of local food, products, and art. Two of us ordered biscuits and gravy, two of us ordered corned beef and hash, and we were all so pleased and full by the last bite. After placing our orders, the woman in the kitchen directed us to hot cider and hot coffee. The biscuits were great, the English muffins were homemade and incredible, and the eggs were fresh and orange-yolked. The meat was delicious and raised by neighboring farmers. Produce was available for purchase in a display cooler in the dining area. We couldn't have been more lucky with finding Jersey Girls as a wonderful breakfast stop.

Unjustified pricing that were not explained or listed on the menu. I can easily go elsewhere for the exact same offering! This is what happened after ordering my simple lunch on the go: I called in an egg white omelette platter (comes with home fries and toast). This is listed on the menu as $4.75. I asked for peppers to be added to the omelette. I got to the store and was ready to pay and she tried to charge me $8 and some change. I expressed my confusion about the price to which she responded that was incorrect. She then changed the price to $6.95. I grabbed a menu from the full menu display in front of the register and showed her the egg white omelette platter listed for $4.75, to which she said the additional cost was for peppers. ""$2 for peppers?!!?!!""  I paid it and rushed back to my office. I realized after I returned that adding meat to the platter is $2, so why was I being charged $2 for peppers?? I called the store to express my frustration and confusion at being charged $2 for simple addition of peppers, which was the same cost as meat. FIRST she informs me that the menu was WRONG and outdated. Yes, the same menu I grabbed AT THE REGISTER to point out the pricing. She said the pricing was on the wall for $5.50 (which of course in no way matches the millions of printed menus, how is a customer supposed to know that?) and that I was being charged $1.50 for the peppers. $1.50 for PEPPERS??!??!

If the food had taste, I would have forgotten about the poor portion. We also ordered the chicken butter masala,  which was no where near what butter masala should taste like. It was lacking the rich creamy and buttery taste. And we also ordered a traditional indian style chicken curry which was worse than what you find in the freezer section at your local indian grocery store.  It was tarty probably from not using the correct tomatoes.  The naan bread and the rice were the only things that were ok. I also understand that because of its location and majority of its clientele not being indian, that they have to ease up on the strong indian spices,  but don't call yourself an indian restaurant if you cant serve up the real flavors.

Unfortunately, the menu at Hon Sushi does not meet the bold face they present.  Unless you have never heard of a volcano roll, there is nothing to surprise.  The menu ranges from sushi, noodles, katsus, and a few Korean dishes.   We started with the fried calamari which looked crisp and smelled delicious.  When we bit into them, however, the batter was over-fried and the inside was rubbery.  My wife ordered sashimi which had a dozen or so very small pieces of fish.  I ordered a sumo roll (fried soft shell crab with tuna and salmon on top), a yellowtail and scallion roll, and a spicy salmon roll.  The rolls looked as if they had been sliced with a plastic butter knife, and they had very little fish in them.  We also ordered three pieces of salmon sashimi a la carte; each piece cost $3.  I've been to places in the city where $4 would get you two pieces of generously cut fish.  At Hon, the pieces were tiny.  The small portions were not completely unwelcome since all the sushi was too warm and too chewy.  Sushi should melt in the mouth; at the very least, it should not be 10-minute chewed bazooka gum.

I couldn't help comparing them to Chipotle. I just wanted someplace close by that I could enjoy without burning half a tank of gas to do so. On the plus side.

The manager (Jill) replied that they serve fish & chips all the time and everyone loves it. My friend said this serving doesn't taste right, the fish tastes bad and she would either like something else or to take this off the bill. The manager refused. She told her ""everyone loves our fish & chips"" and that she'll wrap it up for her to take home. My friend again said that she didn't want this bad fish wrapped up she wanted it take off the bill. The manager said she refused to take the meal off the bill, took the food into the kitchen and sent the waitress back out with the wrapped meal. When my friend informed the waitress that she did not want this wrapped up the waitress rolled her eyes and walked away. Another friend in our party tried to speak with ""Jill"" separately and reason with her, but she would not have it. She refused to take the bad food off the bill. Jill said that the way the woman in our party spoke to her when she complained about the food was too abrupt, so therefore she wasn't taking the food off the bill. I don't understand how this woman keeps her job. I also paid for this bill so basically I'm the one who got screwed here. This place isn't worth it.

I really could have eaten cardboard with more flavor. The chipotle mayo had no hint of chipotle spice or smokiness or anything at all. I think it may have just been colored mayo honestly. The bun was super greasy too. My fiance got a beef burger that was supposed to be medium rare and was closer to medium or well. He said it was ok. The fries were pretty decent, but for being a spectacular burger joint, I wasn't impressed. Also, for two burgers, fries and iced teas, the bill was $30. That's outrageous.

Maybe they forgot the truffle oil because it tasted like egg in a hole with no truffle... or butter or anything with flavor. It was also described as ""with asparagus."" I had looked forward to sinking my teeth into a spear or two. It was maybe half a spear diced up into teeny pieces, almost unnoticeable. We also ordered the uvo pizza. For $2 you could add speck. I'm not sure how they priced that out. It was, estimating, half a slice of speck, torn into specks, lost somewhere on the already bare pizza. For $2, gimme something to work with.
